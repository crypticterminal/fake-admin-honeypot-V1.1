# Honeypot Fake Admin Panel

_This is the new version (1.1.8) of Admin Honeypot_

This is an effective and powerful honeypot fake admin CP for the security site. Honeypot for the attackers! 
It is compatible only with the pH7CMS (my CMS).

P.S. The CMS includes already tracking analytics to have a trace of the attacker on your site.
